# PoseCNNDocker
PoseCNN Dockerfile and launch command

PoseCNN was one of the most difficult libraries I ever compiled and I wouldn't even have a chance if it was not for
[@Kaju-Bubanja](https://github.com/Kaju-Bubanja/PoseCNN). 

To get the demo working, run `sudo sh launch.sh`. Sudo is only needed for the apt installs.
This *does not* compile lib_kinect or Synthesizer. For those, I assume inside the image you can follow what
Kaju-Bubanja has written, but I have not tested this.
